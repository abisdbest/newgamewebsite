Sys36 Feedback Utility
======================

This utility allows users to submit feedback reports to Sys36 for the current build.

Feedback may include, but is not limited to comments, issues, or just general feedback.

Note that this option is only available in debug builds and cannot be enabled in production builds.

How does it work?
-----------------

You can submit a feedback report by clicking the "Comments?" button above your desired application window.

What information is collected?
------------------------------

The following information is collected when sending a feedback report:

 - Any details which you provide via the feedback form.
 - Current window data
    - Screenshot of the current window.
    - Exact window contents.
 - Environment information (browser properties, etc.)
    - User agent
    - OS version info (build ID, version string, etc.)
    - Last boot log
 - The date and time when the report was made.

Important Notes
---------------
 - Apps which utilize IFrames will not have their contents captured properly.

 - Before submitting a feedback report, ensure that any personal/sensitive information is missing. You bear full responsibility for what you send us with this tool.

 - Describe your problems to the best of your ability.

 - Do not use this tool to be abusive, real human beings will read these reports. Think of the person on the other end.
