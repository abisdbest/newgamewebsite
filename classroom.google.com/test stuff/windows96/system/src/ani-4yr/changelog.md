## ü•≥ Happy Birthday, Windows 96!
### (And welcome to  Windows 96 Version 3.1)
### Date // 10/04/2023

Your favorite web operating system Windows 96 turns 4 today!

We've come a long way and we thank all of our users for having been a part of this amazing journey so far!

#### General changes

 + Windows 96 MC reopened and updated to the latest Minecraft version (1.19.4) `mc.windows96.net`
 + Userland sources are now available to the public. This should hopefully make total conversion mods much easier to make. You can find these sources at [https://git.sys36.net/windows-96/sys-userland](https://git.sys36.net/windows-96/sys-userland).
 + MsgRoom standalone ([msgroom.windows96.net](https://msgroom.windows96.net)) now has proper meta tags to classify it as a web application. In other words, you should now be able to add MsgRoom to your homescreen and have it run as if it were an app.

#### OS Specific Changes
Alongside the anniversary itself, we have also updated the OS and its components. These updates include:

 + Added more languages to Monaco and the option to change themes within the editor.
 + MsgRoom has been updated:
    - The app is now responsive and will therework better on mobile phones or small devices.
    - Emoji shortcodes have been added. Try entering `:neutral_face:` in a message to render the üòê emoji.
    - You can right click the message of a user to copy the user ID or to block them.
    - Bot and User API are WIP and may be released later this week if time allows us :)
 + Terminal style has been updated
 + New YAML API added at `w96.yaml`. This API uses the jsyaml package, a popular YAML library for JavaScript.
 + New API samples added in `W:/system/sdks/sdk-v3/examples`.
 + Introduced `.wrt` script files which run under WRT when opened.
