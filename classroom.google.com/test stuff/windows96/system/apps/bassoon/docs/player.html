<h2>Standalone player</h2>
<div id="info">
    BassoonTracker provides a standalone player library that you can use in your own projects, to play module files without the tracker interface.<br>
    In addition to playing songs, you can also trigger samples individually.<br>
    This is especially well-suited for small (web) games:
    <ul>
        <li>.mod and .xm files are usually much smaller than .mp3 files</li>
        <li>You can have several looping "subsongs" in 1 file, so for example you could have a different tune for each game section without loading additional data</li>
        <li>You can embed your sound-FX samples in the same file and still one-shot play them</li>
    </ul>
    The complete playback library is only 19.8 kb when gzipped (56 kb when uncompressed, 41 kb when <a href="https://github.com/Siorki/RegPack" target="_blank">regpacked</a>).<br>

    You'll find a <a href="http://www.stef.be/bassoontracker/player/" target="_blank">simple example here</a>.<br>
    Hit the "play" button above to start the playback.<br>

    
    <h3>Library and sample code</h3>
    Download the <a href="https://github.com/steffest/BassoonTracker/tree/master/player">bassoonplayer-min.js file</a>, include it in your project's HTML page, and you're good to go!<br>
    If size matters and you don't need any advanced stuff, use the <a href="https://github.com/steffest/BassoonTracker/blob/master/player/b-zip.js">b-zip.js file</a> which is only 29.2 kb (Thanks <a href="https://github.com/steffest/BassoonTracker/pull/67/commits/8b778cc6b85adfc56e8c72d27f3dbafb6d2fbf3e">Dr. Snuggles</a>)<br>
    <br>
    The most simple example would be:
    <xmp>
        <script src="bassoonplayer-min.js"></script>
        <script>
            BassoonTracker.init(true);
            BassoonTracker.load("url/to/file.mod", true);
        </script>
    </xmp>

    The second parameter in <code>BassoonTracker.load</code> defines whether the song should autoplay once loaded or not. (please note that some browsers need user interaction first before media playback is enabled)<br>
    <br>
    You can use a third parameter as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function">callback function</a>, triggered when the loading of the file is complete:<br>

    <xmp>
        <script>
            BassoonTracker.load("url/to/file.mod", false, function(){
            	... do something
            });
        </script>
    </xmp>

    After BassoonTracker.init is loaded, you might want to check "Audio.context" to see if the browser supports <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Webaudio</a>.<br>
    
    
    <h3>Useful methods</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>BassoonTracker.togglePlay()</code></li>
        <li><code>BassoonTracker.isPlaying()</code></li>
        <li><code>BassoonTracker.playSong()</code></li>
        <li><code>BassoonTracker.stop()</code></li>
        <li><code>BassoonTracker.getTrackCount()</code></li>
        <li><code>BassoonTracker.getSong()</code> <span>(gets the current song)</span>
            <ul>
                <li><code>BassoonTracker.getSong().title</code></li>
                <li><code>BassoonTracker.getSong().length</code> <span>(in patterns)</span></li>
                <li><code>BassoonTracker.getSong().patterns</code> <span>(array of patterns)</span></li>
                <li><code>BassoonTracker.getSong().patternTable</code> <span>(array of pattern positions in the song)</span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><code>BassoonTracker.setCurrentSongPosition(songPos)</code></li>
        <li><code>BassoonTracker.playSample(sampleIndex,sampleRate)</code></li>
        <li><code>BassoonTracker.getBPM</code></li>
        <li><code>BassoonTracker.getAmigaSpeed</code></li>
        <li><code>BassoonTracker.audio</code> (pointer to the main audio object)</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Indicating playback progress</h3>
    
    The playback itself is scheduled in WebAudio and completely detached from the main JavaSscript thread.<br>
    Therefore there are no direct events to indicate playback progress.<br>
    If you want to display some UI with a progress indicator you will have to keep track of the start time of the song (<code>Audio.context.currentTime</code>)
    and call
    <code>BassoonTracker.getStateAtTime(time)</code> periodically <br>(or <code>BassoonTracker.getTimeStates()</code> to get the complete list).<br>
    Note that the player schedules audio ahead, so the last item in the <code>BassoonTracker.getTimeStates()</code> list will be in the future.<br>

    <h3>Displaying pattern data</h3>
    When a song is playing you can get the current pattern and row that is being played with <code>BassoonTracker.getStateAtTime(BassoonTracker.audio.context.currentTime)</code><br>
    This returns an object with 2 properties: songPos and patternPos.<br>
    You can then get the current pattern using BassoonTracker.getSong().patterns[BassoonTracker.getSong().patternTable[songPos]]<br>
    For a full example, please refer to the <a href="http://www.stef.be/bassoontracker/player/pattern.html" target="_blank">Pattern View demo</a>
    <br>
    

    <h3>Adjusting volume</h3>
    If you want to adjust to volume, you can use <code>BassoonTracker.audio.masterVolume</code> which is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GainNode">WebAudio GainNode</a>.<br>
    If you want to adjust the volume for a specific track (e.g. to mute it), you can access each tracks audio output using <code>BassoonTracker.audio.filterChains[i].output()</code> which is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GainNode">WebAudio GainNode</a>. (where i is the 0-based index of the track)<br>
