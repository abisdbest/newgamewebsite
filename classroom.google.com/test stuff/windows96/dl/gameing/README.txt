The Binaries are compressed with 7-zip due to its incredible compression ratio.
It will save us bandwidth and will save you download time!

How to extract:
 - For windows, use 7-zip from http://7-zip.org
 - For mac, download The Unarchiver
 - For linux, install p7zip

Some additional notes:
 - Standalone versions of gameing will not be updated often (it's time consuming to push new builds for each platform often).
   Therefore, if you always want the latest game, it will be available in windows96.net.
 - You may need a decent video card to play gameing.
