            <b>Developer:</b><br>
            Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game developed by Robert Donner for IBM's OS/2 operating system, later included in Microsoft Windows.

          <h1>Minesweeper: Uncover the Mines, Exercise Your Mind</h1>
          
          <p>
            Minesweeper, a beloved classic, challenges players to uncover hidden mines on a grid while avoiding detonating any of them. Developed by Robert Donner for IBM's OS/2 operating system, Minesweeper gained widespread popularity when it was included as a standard feature in Microsoft Windows, becoming a staple of casual gaming for millions of players worldwide.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <i>Gameplay:</i><br>
            In Minesweeper, players are presented with a grid of covered squares, some of which conceal mines. The objective is to uncover all the non-mine squares without triggering any mines. Players can uncover a square by clicking on it, and if the square contains a mine, the game ends. However, if the square is safe, it reveals a number indicating the total number of mines in adjacent squares. Using logic and deduction, players strategically flag potential mines and clear safe squares to progress through the game.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <i>Strategy and Skill:</i><br>
            Minesweeper is not merely a game of chance but one that requires logical thinking and strategic planning. Players must carefully analyze the revealed numbers to deduce the locations of mines, often employing techniques such as pattern recognition and probability estimation. With practice, players can improve their skills and tackle increasingly challenging grids with confidence.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <i>Enduring Appeal:</i><br>
            Despite its simple concept, Minesweeper offers endless replayability and appeals to players of all ages. Its addictive nature stems from the satisfaction of successfully uncovering squares and the thrill of avoiding hidden mines. The game's accessibility and intuitive gameplay make it a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences decades after its initial release.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Whether you're a seasoned Minesweeper enthusiast or a newcomer eager to test your wits, Minesweeper provides a rewarding and intellectually stimulating gaming experience. So, dive into the grid, sharpen your mind, and see if you have what it takes to conquer the mines.
